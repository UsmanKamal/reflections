When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I work on multiple computers or there are more people working on a project so all can access the system at one place.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There might be changes which need to be reviewed before getting pulled. GitHub cannot review them itself.
