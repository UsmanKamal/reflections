When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I work on multiple computers or there are more people working on a project so all can access the system at one place.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There might be changes which need to be reviewed before getting pulled. GitHub cannot review them itself.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: are clones of anyone's repo in the context of GitHub which are only available on GitHub. Used to have anyone's repo
Clones: are copies of a repository at a local system or at GitHub. Same as above but we can also make clones of forks
Branches: are sort of small part of a project like some experimental feature. A project can have multiple branches,
used for experimental features usually while not disturbing the normal flow of work.
